    what your changes are help us organize PRs and streamline the committing process.
3. Make a branch from the develop branch using the following naming convention:
    1. `YOUR_INITIALS/ISSUE#-DESCRIPTIVE-NAME`
    2. For example, `kb/94-create-contributingmd` was the branch that had the commit containing this
    tutorial.
4. Commit your changes!
5. When you have completed making all your changes, create a Pull Request (PR) from your git manager
or our Github repo.
6. In the comment for the PR write `Resolves #___` and fill the blank with the issue number you
created earlier.
    1. For example, the comment we wrote for the PR with this tutorial was `Resolves #94`
