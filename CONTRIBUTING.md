## Contributing your changes

1. If one does not exist already, open an issue that your contribution is going to resolve or fix.
    1. Make sure to give the issue a clear title and a very focused description.
    2. Mark your issue with the appropriate label (Example:`android`, `iOS`) to indicate which platform you are contributing to. 
2. On the issue page, set the appropriate Pipeline, Label(s), Milestone, and assign the issue to
yourself.
    1. We use Zenhub to organize our issues and plan our releases. Giving as much information as to
    what your changes are help us organize PRs and streamline the committing process.
3. Make a branch from the master branch using the following naming convention:
    1. `YOUR_INITIALS/ISSUE#-DESCRIPTIVE-NAME`
    2. For example, `kb/94-create-contributingmd` was the branch that had the commit containing this
    tutorial.
4. Commit your changes!
5. When you have completed making all your changes, create a Pull Request (PR) from your git manager
or our Github repo from your branch to master.
6. Fill in the template for the PR.
7. Contributions require sign-off. We require that any contributers agree to the [Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1 (DCO)](http://elinux.org/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin), otherwise your pull request will be rejected.
    1. When committing using the command line you can sign off using the --signoff or -s flag. This adds a Signed-off-by line by the committer at the end of the commit log message.`git commit -s -m "Commit message"`
8. That's it, thanks for the contribution!
